# **All About That Art**: _A Virtual Art Community_

## **Description**  
-------------
_All About That Art_ was built with the idea of creating a virtual art community. Our mission is to inspire individuals to create. We believe in art as therapy, promoting art and creating a safe place for artist and viewers. Users will now have a community to share art and connect with others who are _all about that art_. 

Users will be able to create profiles, as an _Artist_ or an _Art Viewer_. Users will be able to view, comment, and learn about different artist. Users will also have access to our top picks to see art in person.

 ## **How to Use**
 ---------------
- The user would start on the homepage where they will be able navigate the site to view artist,  "**FIND A BREWERY**" button. 
   **_It's up to the user to decide that!_** 😉

- The user will select a category for the types of recipes they would like to view. This will generate _nine_ different recipe cards with an image that the user can look through and select the one they would like to prepare.

- When the user clicks on a recipe card, the complete recipe will become viewable. The recipe will contain an image of the recipe, ingredient list and instructions.

- The user can search for a list of breweries in their city by clicking on the "**FIND A BREWERY**" button. When the button is clicked, a modal with an input field will appear instructing the user to enter the city they want to search.

- After the user enters the city and clicks submit, the modal will populate to give the names of three different breweries in their city.

- A user will be able to come back to the FIND A BREWERY modal and find the last city they have searched for. Making it easy to search for that city again.
