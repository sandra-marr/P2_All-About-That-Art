# **All About That Art**: _A Virtual Art Community_

## **Description**  
-------------
_All About That Art_ was built with the idea of creating a virtual art community. Our mission is to inspire individuals to create. We believe in art as therapy, promoting art and creating a safe place for artist and viewers. Users will now have a community to share art and connect with others who are _all about that art_. 

Users will be able to create profiles, as an _Artist_ or an _Art Viewer_. Users will be able to view, comment, and learn about different artist. Users will also have access to our top picks to see art in person.

 ## **How to Use**
 ---------------
- The user would start on the homepage where they will be able navigate the site to view: artist, gallery of the artwork or the recommendations page to see art. The login and sign up button are also found on the homepage. A feature artist work is also included for the users to view.

- Once the user is logged on to their account, they will be taken to their dashboard. The user would be able to update their profile information such as, their personal bio, social media accounts, and username. They would also be able to upload their personal artwork to be displayed in the gallery and their artist profiles.
